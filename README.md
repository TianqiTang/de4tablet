The DE4 Tablet is a portable tablet computer designed by the Computer
Laboratory at the University of Cambridge.

It uses a Terasic DE4 FPGA board with an Altera Stratix IV FPGA.  It has a
full set of peripherals on the DE4, as well as a battery, touchscreen and
HDMI output - you can give presentations from your own FPGA design!

This is the mechanical design - what you put on the FPGA is up to you!
We hope to open source more of the components we use on our boards in
future.

To build the Tablet you will need:

[A DE4 FPGA board](http://de4.terasic.com.tw) (we used the SGX230 version)  
[Terasic Multi-touch LCD module](http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=68&No=653)  
[HDMI Transmitter Daughter Card](http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=66&No=582) (optional)  
[Energizer XP8000 battery](http://www.energizerpowerpacks.com/uk/products/xp8000/) (optional, ours came from CPC)  
[PicoPSU-80 voltage converter](http://www.mini-itx.com/store/psu)  
Some 1, 2, 3 and 4mm acrylic for laser cutting pieces  
A collection of M3 screws and pillars - see the full parts list  

There are two versions - one with battery and HDMI output and the other
without.  These instructions assume you're building the battery version -
the non-battery version is simpler and you can just omit steps relating to
the HDMI and battery.
